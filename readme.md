# CTEC3905 Assignment
Initial code for the website was taken from the boilerplate code that was already generated.

# Notes
* Slight issue with the branching (the branch was displayed as merging in correctly) meant I had to revert to an early working state using `git reset --hard 0c9a77d`

# References
* Body Grid layout for overall webpage was adapted from my Lab 6 work
* Projects layout was adapted from [here] (https://getflywheel.com/layout/card-layout-css-grid-layout-how-to/)
